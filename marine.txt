# Marine's Devotion

Two loves he carries through this fragile world:
His rifle, sleek and deadly in his hands,
And she who waits, with patient heart unfurled,
Their future built on more than shifting sands.

One guards his life through battles fiercely fought,
The other guards his soul with gentle grace.
Between them both, his loyalty is caughtâ€”
Twin stars that guide him home to love's embrace.
